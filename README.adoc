== Neo4j Meetup Import for Community Graph (and others)

Currently uses Python and iPython Notebook, the Meetup API via requests.

Run the script and notebook server with these environment variables:

.nb.sh
----
cat ../nb.sh 
export NEO4J_URL=bolt://localhost
export NEO4J_USER=neo4j
export NEO4J_PASSWORD=****
export MEETUP_KEY='...'

ipython notebook 
----

=== Approach

* Use Meetup APIs, load groups with topic Neo4j
* Fetch 
* Use idempotent Cypher statement to merge Meetups, Users, Topics, 

=== Data Model

Uses the Meetup part of this data model:

=== TODO

* store in json files and then import those
* manage updates
* update organizers correctly
